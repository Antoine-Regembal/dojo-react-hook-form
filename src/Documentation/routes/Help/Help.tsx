				<h3>Step by Step</h3>
				<p>
					Do not change too much things at once if you are not
					comfortable with React, that could lead to a really hard
					time to make tests passing again.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you are really stuck in the refactoring process, these
					steps should help you be back on the track :
				</p>
				<ul className="block">
					<li>Import useForm hook into your component file</li>
					<li>
						Create an instance of the useForm hook inside your
						component and get the functions from it that will allow
						you to manage fields (like register). Check the
						documentation to see which parameters you could give to
						useForm to get the desired behavior from it ðŸ˜‰
					</li>
					<li>
						Register the fields into react-hook-form. Also if
						needed, define validation requirements for each fields
						with generic or custom rules and messages
					</li>
					<li>
						Remove legacy fields controls like onChange, onBlur,
						value. By default, react-hook-form do that for you
						(depending of the configuration you give to the useForm
						hook)
					</li>
					<li>
						When form is submited by clicking on the Submit button,
						make react-hook-form handle submition by getting the right function from useForm
					</li>
					<li>
						Get the formState from useForm and manage to display fields errors below them
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					When the refactoring process is done, the useReducer originaly used for form
					state and errors management becomes useless and can be deleted.
					It is the same thing for the validateForm and validateFieldRules functions.
				</p>
